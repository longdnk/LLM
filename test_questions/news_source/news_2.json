      "Broadcom was originally a semiconductor and electronics company, but since merging with Avago Technologies in 2016, it has been on an acquisition spree. It spent a total of nearly $100 billion buying semiconductor equipment company CA Technologies in 2018, cybersecurity giant Symantec in 2019, and cloud software developer VMware in 2023.",
      "The acquisitions have propelled Broadcom stock to a 465% gain over the last five years and, earlier this year, it soared past $1,800, which made it somewhat inaccessible to investors with small portfolios. As a result, Broadcom's management team decided to execute a 10-for-1 ",
      ", which increased the number of shares in circulation tenfold and reduced the price per share by a proportional amount.",
      "The split went into effect on July 12, so investors can now buy one share of Broadcom for just $162 as of this writing. That spells an opportunity because the company's growing presence in artificial intelligence (AI) could drive further upside from here.",
      "Broadcom has placed a heavy focus on AI across its organization over the past year to capture what could be one of the most valuable technological revolutions in history.",
      "On the semiconductor side, Broadcom makes data center accelerators, which are specially designed chips for AI development. It also supplies networking equipment for data centers, including Ethernet switches that regulate how quickly data travels from one point to another. High-quality switches are critical to ",
      ", because data needs to rapidly flow through tens of thousands of graphics processors (GPUs) and accelerators.",
      "During the recent third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Aug. 4), Broadcom said its custom AI accelerators segment grew by three-and-a-half times compared to the year-ago period thanks to surging demand from hyperscalers (which typically includes Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet). The company also said its Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3-AI switches delivered fourfold sales growth compared to the year-ago period.",
      "Outside of the semiconductor business, Symantec is weaving AI into its cybersecurity products. For example, it launched SymantecAI earlier this year, which is a chatbot capable of answering users' queries about their endpoint protection.",
      "Then, there is VMware, which serves as the software layer of the data center to help organizations optimize their infrastructure. They can use VMware to create virtual machines, meaning multiple employees can plug into the same server to utilize all of its capacity. That ensures no computing capacity goes to waste, which is critical right now due to the short supply of high-powered GPUs and data center hardware.",
      "Broadcom expects to deliver $51.5 billion in total revenue for the entirety of fiscal 2024, which will wrap up at the end of October. The company's guidance initially suggested $11 billion of that would be attributable to AI across its businesses, but it just raised that estimate to $12 billion, which highlights the significant momentum in this emerging space.",
      "As I touched on at the top, Broadcom has a market cap of $761 billion right now, so its stock only needs to gain 31.4% from here to place the company in the $1 trillion club.",
      "The company isn't consistently profitable on a GAAP basis, so it can't be valued using the traditional price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. However, we can value it using the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, which divides its market cap by its annual revenue.",
      "Broadcom currently trades at a P/S ratio of 16. If that number remains constant, the company simply has to grow its annual revenue by 31.4% to justify its entry into the $1 trillion club. Wall Street expects Broadcom's revenue to grow by 17.2% in fiscal 2025, which won't be enough, but it could get there in fiscal 2026 if it can grow by that amount again.",
      "There is a caveat. Although Broadcom's P/S ratio is down from its peak of around 19, it's still very expensive compared to its average of 8.7 over the last five years:",
      "It's clear why investors are willing to pay a premium for the stock right now -- Broadcom's AI semiconductor products are delivering explosive growth, and its acquisitions are adding a tremendous amount of value. However, there is no guarantee investors will be receptive to such a high P/S ratio over the long term, and a reduction back to its five-year average could add ",
      "to Broadcom's quest to join the $1 trillion club.",
      "Therefore, while Broadcom will be a spectacular stock to own during the AI revolution, investors should maintain a very long-term outlook (perhaps of a decade or more) if they buy it today. That will give the company plenty of time to grow into its current valuation.",

      "The firm last month posted 21% sales growth and a record high gross margin for the latest quarter despite anemic consumer spending. Backed by strong results, its Hong Kong-listed stock has surged 63% this year, outperforming all global food-delivery peers and topping the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index in 2024.",
      "Meituan’s secret weapon is its cheaper, group-based Pin Hao Fan platform for ordering meals. The service’s success has helped cushion the company’s results so far, but concerns are growing about whether that offering alone will be able to defy the broader consumer slump.",
      "“It’s a tricky one, because on one hand you’re seeing this robust revenue growth relative to other platforms, but on the other hand, you still have macro that’s weighing it down,” said Morningstar Inc. analyst Kai Wang. “And there’s still a long-term risk with regard to competition.”",
      "For now at least, Meituan has benefited from a reduced threat by rivals. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is focusing on bolstering its core e-commerce business rather than its Ele.me food-delivery operation, while ByteDance Ltd.’s Douyin is emphasizing profitability over market share.",
      "In addition to winning over customers, Pin Hao Fan is also attracting restaurants that are keen to advertise their cheaper products. As a result, the number of transacting users and active merchants both hit record highs on Meituan’s platforms in the second quarter.",
      "The company has scored some early success with its push outside of mainland China as well, with its KeeTa delivery app in Hong Kong.",
      "Among other things that have gone right, driver recruiting costs have dropped amid elevated youth unemployment, while Meituan has also saved money by shuttering underperforming warehouses and lowering user subsidies. On top of all this, a new $1 billion stock buyback helped boost investor confidence.",
      "“The company is obviously adopting a low-price strategy to grab more market share and cater to the trend of consumption downgrade in China,” said Daniel So, a trading strategist at Goldhorse Capital Management (HK) Ltd. “But if the overall consumption is really weak, the new initiatives wouldn’t translate into a meaningful growth driver.”",
      "Clouds are gathering, with China’s shaky economy starting to even pressure sales at value champion and former market darling PDD Holdings Inc. Catering chain stocks have been tumbling amid sluggish results, and restaurant sales growth has slowed to the weakest pace since pandemic lockdowns, according to data from China’s National Bureau of Statistics.",
      "With many restaurants struggling for survival and consumer confidence deteriorating, “we continue to argue that Meituan’s revenue growth rate will likely decelerate,” said Barclays PLC analyst Jiong Shao, the only analyst among the 62 tracked by Bloomberg who recommends selling the stock. Analysts on average forecast its sales growth will slow to 16% in 2025 from 21% this year.",

      "Risks are also on the rise as positioning in Meituan’s stock gets more crowded, according to Xiadong Bao, a fund manager at Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management.

Given recent employment data that suggests the US economy could be wobbling, the markets will be assessing whether this rate cut and future ones (the Fed signaled more to come in 2024 and 2025) are the right moves at the right time or whether they're too little, too late for a macro that has already cooled.",

      "(Bloomberg) -- Meituan’s strategy to focus on lower prices has helped the Chinese food delivery company beat sales targets even as the slowing economy drags peers. Investors are now wondering whether its steep share-price gains can last as the macro weakness deepens.",
      "Most Read from Bloomberg",
      "The firm last month posted 21% sales growth and a record high gross margin for the latest quarter despite anemic consumer spending. Backed by strong results, its Hong Kong-listed stock has surged 63% this year, outperforming all global food-delivery peers and topping the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index in 2024.",
      "Meituan’s secret weapon is its cheaper, group-based Pin Hao Fan platform for ordering meals. The service’s success has helped cushion the company’s results so far, but concerns are growing about whether that offering alone will be able to defy the broader consumer slump.",
      "“It’s a tricky one, because on one hand you’re seeing this robust revenue growth relative to other platforms, but on the other hand, you still have macro that’s weighing it down,” said Morningstar Inc. analyst Kai Wang. “And there’s still a long-term risk with regard to competition.”",
      "For now at least, Meituan has benefited from a reduced threat by rivals. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is focusing on bolstering its core e-commerce business rather than its Ele.me food-delivery operation, while ByteDance Ltd.’s Douyin is emphasizing profitability over market share.",
      "In addition to winning over customers, Pin Hao Fan is also attracting restaurants that are keen to advertise their cheaper products. As a result, the number of transacting users and active merchants both hit record highs on Meituan’s platforms in the second quarter.",
      "The company has scored some early success with its push outside of mainland China as well, with its KeeTa delivery app in Hong Kong.",
      "Among other things that have gone right, driver recruiting costs have dropped amid elevated youth unemployment, while Meituan has also saved money by shuttering underperforming warehouses and lowering user subsidies. On top of all this, a new $1 billion stock buyback helped boost investor confidence.",
      "“The company is obviously adopting a low-price strategy to grab more market share and cater to the trend of consumption downgrade in China,” said Daniel So, a trading strategist at Goldhorse Capital Management (HK) Ltd. “But if the overall consumption is really weak, the new initiatives wouldn’t translate into a meaningful growth driver.”",
      "Clouds are gathering, with China’s shaky economy starting to even pressure sales at value champion and former market darling PDD Holdings Inc. Catering chain stocks have been tumbling amid sluggish results, and restaurant sales growth has slowed to the weakest pace since pandemic lockdowns, according to data from China’s National Bureau of Statistics.",
      "With many restaurants struggling for survival and consumer confidence deteriorating, “we continue to argue that Meituan’s revenue growth rate will likely decelerate,” said Barclays PLC analyst Jiong Shao, the only analyst among the 62 tracked by Bloomberg who recommends selling the stock. Analysts on average forecast its sales growth will slow to 16% in 2025 from 21% this year.",
      "Valuations may not provide much reason for further upside. The shares are trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio to 16 times, down from recent highs but still pricier than Hong Kong-traded tech peers. PDD and Alibaba are both trading below 10 times expected profits.",
