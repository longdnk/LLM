{"title": "Northvolt Founder’s Next Big Green Bet Has a Power Problem", "content": "(Bloomberg) -- After a four-decade career teaching soldiers to fire grenades, machine guns and howitzers, Lars Hjerpe was looking forward to a quiet retirement in the untamed woods of Sweden’s far north. Instead, he got a front-row seat to one of the world’s biggest experiments in green industrialization. Most Read from Bloomberg It’s been loud. Trucks regularly swirl up large dust clouds in front of Hjerpe’s idyllic red cottage, where he’d dreamed of peacefully tending to the land and feeding his hens, as workers erect the world’s first large-scale green steel plant across the street. The megafactory is part of a $100 billion effort to clean up some of the world’s most polluting sectors. If it works, an area bigger than England near the Arctic Circle could become a key European supplier of everything from green steel to climate-friendly batteries, fuels and fertilizers. The disruption has caused angst in Hjerpe’s small town of Boden, though many of his fellow locals also acknowledge its potential to revive the area. “There’s a lot of division over the project,” he says over coffee and homemade cakes in his kitchen. “It might be really bad for me, but overall it’s a good thing that will create jobs for the young.” Success is far from guaranteed. The steel factory built by Stegra AB is part of a cluster of projects backed by Vargas Holding AB, a Swedish impact investor whose mission is to cut global emissions by 1% — the equivalent of annual carbon pollution from Australia. But its other big industrial bet, an electric-vehicle battery maker called Northvolt AB, is now running out of cash and facing an uncertain future. Both companies used contracts from future customers to borrow billions of dollars and build operations from scratch. In fact, the idea for pursuing green steel came out of a Northvolt board meeting. But Northvolt is now facing a liquidity crisis as its rapid expansion — including a large factory in a town south of Boden and plans for units in Germany and Canada — falters amid slowing EV demand and manufacturing challenges. The troubles have taken Sweden and Northvolt’s investors by surprise, given the company’s much vaunted status as a green flag-bearer. Harald Mix, the billionaire founder of Vargas, defended the companies’ similar funding model in an e-mail and traced Northvolt’s problems back to operational and market factors instead. “When industries need to fundamentally transform to lead or adapt to the green transition, significant investments are required,” he said. The money Stegra and Northvolt raised was based on “rigorous analysis” that also included the consequences of not investing in clean technologies. The two businesses “quickly developed into unique individuals,” Stegra Chief Executive Officer Henrik Henriksson said in an interview this week. Stegra is laser-focused on making the Boden plant a success before investing in other factories, he said. “We live and die with Boden.” But the stakes are high and, from the corridors of power in Stockholm to the dinner tables of Boden, Sweden’s green revolution is being fiercely debated. Northern Sweden could serve as a blueprint for other nations to reach net zero and revitalize neglected regions. But the projects, including the Stegra steel plant, will gobble up so much electricity that they risk turning a surplus of clean power — the region’s draw in the first place — into a deficit. It’s a classic climate Catch-22: Is it better to build the factories of tomorrow right now, in the hope that energy resources and customer demand catch up, or more prudent to slow down and risk missing the planet’s brief chance to stem global warming? For Boden’s Mayor Claes Nordmark, the Stegra plant is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The town has a deep military history and its fortunes have tracked Sweden’s dedication to stemming threats from the east. His mandatory national service coincided with the military’s decision to scale down in Boden, which caused its population to plunge in the late 1990s. It’s never really recovered. “The window is this small,” Nordmark says, holding his hands out inches apart. “We have to grab this chance, otherwise the train will leave.” A few hours drive along deserted roads northwest of Boden, Svenska Kraftnat AB, Sweden’s high-voltage grid operator, is working furiously to expand the region’s electricity system. In a fresh clearing stretching 380 kilometers (236 miles) in Sweden and Finland, its workers are assembling a new 4 billion-krona ($390 million) electric highway called Aurora Line. On a late morning on Sept. 13, two workers climbed 25 meters up in the air to attach a long beam across a steel tower that will hold up power lines. The specialist team of Albanian workers, led by a Canadian foreman, were due to erect another tower before the day was over. About 250 meters or so further ahead, the next structure had already been prepared. Eventually, more than 650 of them will sit on the Swedish side alone. The original plan for the link was to mainly export power to Finland, but now it’s also become vital for Sweden’s own green transition. Electricity distribution networks will also need to become more robust. Vattenfall AB, the nation’s biggest utility, says that in the next five years it will expand its grid as much as it has in the past five decades. The firm hopes to offer more grid capacity in the future, especially to users who can be flexible. “Today, the demand for grid capacity is several times that of what is available,” says Vattenfall Eldistribution’s Customer and Markets Director Cecilia Zetterstrom. “Many of our customers want a connection in the next few years and almost all before 2030.” The Boden steel plant by Stegra, previously called H2 Green Steel AB, hasn’t got a grid connection for its second phase that is set to double production of the metal. “We need to get clarity on when we will get power,” says Stegra CEO Henriksson. “We do not have a solution today.” German utility Uniper SE also hasn’t gotten an answer from Vattenfall on a 2021 request to connect a factory it wants to build in Lulea, a town near Boden. The plant will make e-methanol, a green fuel for shipping. Uniper needs a firm yes by this year, says Patrik Hermansson, its head of business development for the Nordics, or its schedule will slip beyond its planned 2029 start. If “things don’t improve soon,” the opportunity for Sweden’s green transition “could go missing,” Hermansson says. “That would be really bad for Sweden AB.” There’s genuine concern there could be an electricity deficit in that part of the country, according to Daniel Gustafsson, Svenska Kraftnat’s head of power system. He says the nation will need an additional nuclear reactor’s worth of electricity per year based on existing industrial plans. “It’s very, very ambitious.” Gustafsson expects wind energy will make up most of the new capacity, with more nuclear power coming online as well. But local municipalities have blocked plans for new onshore wind farms. In the first half of the year, 12 out of 16 projects were vetoed by town authorities, according to the industry’s lobby group. Three were then halted by the military. Vattenfall itself just paused a major offshore wind project, saying it no longer made financial sense. While the government has a bullish plan for nuclear, even the most optimistic forecasters don’t see any new reactors starting up until the middle of the next decade at the earliest. All that is worrying company executives looking to Sweden as an important part of the green supply chain. That includes Jim Rowan, Volvo Car AB’s chief executive officer, who wants the government to speed up its deployment of nuclear power. “There’s not enough renewables that can be put in place in time,” he says. Standing in Boden’s town center, there are few signs this is where the seeds of a new steel industry are being planted. The odd worker in a yellow high-visibility jacket peruses the aisles in the local supermarket. Stegra’s showroom-like office, with a white model of the plant on display, is only open one day a week, according to a sign on its door. Still, the project has come to dominate small town life. Residents are worried the influx of workers stresses their municipal services and infrastructure. A housing crisis across Sweden means that construction is nowhere near what’s needed to accommodate a surge of new arrivals from around the world. It was a problem that Northvolt had to overcome when it arrived in Skelleftea, down the road from Boden, where the company built its first battery plant. Over time, the factory’s presence helped to transform the area as new roads, homes, schools and other social services were added. On a September afternoon, Johan Johansson stood in a Boden parking lot next to a pile of rubble — the last remnants of houses that were torn down in the 1990s. Johansson runs a local housing foundation that owns a third of the town’s rental homes. His organization is building two seven-story blocks that will contain 96 apartments on the plot, a rare housing project underway in Boden. But the one- and two-room flats are aimed at military personnel — one of the town’s main real-estate clientele for decades — not the families that will arrive with Stegra’s employees. Johansson estimates that Boden will need more than 2,500 new homes by 2030. About 330 will be ready from 2024 to 2026, he says. After that, his spreadsheet is empty. Stegra “won’t have a problem getting the plant up and running,” says Johansson, a former lawmaker who helped guide energy and minerals policy. “The big challenge for them will be accommodation, and actually getting all the people needed here and getting them settled.” Officials are counting on these new residents to pay taxes and help ease Boden’s ballooning debt. They had projected that the population would hit 30,000 this year after adding 1,800 people. But in the town’s latest strategic plan published in June, the estimate was revised down to just 12 newcomers in 2024. The municipality aims to have nearly 33,000 residents by 2030. Even if that comes to pass, Boden will still be deep in the red. Debt is now more than 1 billion kronor and is expected to soar above 4 billion kronor by 2031. That money is desperately needed to build new roads, schools and all the other infrastructure required to support the town and the plant. Anders Pettersson, a group leader with a local opposition political party, says the national government needs to step in and help Boden out of its financial hole if it’s serious about the green transition. “This is all getting a bit lost on the national level,” Pettersson says. “My children and grandchildren will feel this for a long, long time.” Magnus Henrekson, an economics professor at the Research Institute of Industrial Economics in Stockholm, has emerged as one of the foremost critics of Sweden’s green plans in the north. He argues that the projects pose a major risk to taxpayers, whose municipalities will be saddled with debt if they invest in infrastructure but the factories don’t work out. “If it fails, it will have very large macroeconomic effects on Sweden,’’ he says. Stegra has only received €100 million from the Swedish government — about 2% of the company’s total funding — according to its CEO Henriksson, who characterized Henrekson’s criticisms as “speculation.” Still, Henrekson has garnered support from some of the Swedish business elite, including billionaire Christer Gardell, co-founder of activist investor Cevian Capital AB. “The taxpayers are taking on significant exposure,” he said by email, referring to the generous state subsidies for the projects. “I am in general quite skeptical of the government’s participation in business.” On the other side are many other prominent figures who stress the need for Sweden to secure a place in the new green economy and help avoid the worst impacts of climate change. That includes the Wallenberg dynasty. The family has been Sweden’s most influential finance player since the mid 19th century, collecting major stakes in many of its largest companies. It was one of Stegra’s early investors. Marcus Wallenberg, chair of Wallenberg Investments AB, told Dagens Industri, a local news outlet, that developing sustainable steel is “absolutely necessary.” (The industry is responsible for about 7% of global carbon emissions.) Wallenberg has argued that business and government need to work together to finance big infrastructure projects to make the green transition work — an approach that countries from the US to China have taken as well. Back outside the Stegra plant in Boden, Hjerpe is staying put in his cottage. While annoying, the construction ruckus is nothing compared with the gunfire he faced in the military. “I’ve just got to stay away from the diggers and the dumpers,” he says. “But I managed to retire without being shot at once, so this is pretty easy.” --With assistance from Charles Daly.

{"title": "Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller Sold 88% of Duquesne's Stake in Nvidia and Is Piling Into 2 Unstoppable Stocks", "content": "Important data releases aren't hard to come by on Wall Street. Monthly employment and inflation reports, coupled with earnings season (i.e., six weeks packed full of operating results from public companies), can make it easy for important data to fly under the radar. While most investors were focused on the heart of earnings season in mid-August, as well as the release of the July inflation report, they may have missed the deadline for Wall Street's smartest and most-successful money managers to file their   with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F provides a clear snapshot of which stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) the top money managers purchased and sold in the latest quarter. What's particularly noteworthy about the latest round of 13Fs is that Wall Street's hottest artificial intelligence (AI) stock,   (NASDAQ: NVDA), was sent to the chopping block by at least seven billionaire asset managers  . Perhaps the most prominent seller was billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office. Druckenmiller tends to minimize risks when investing and attempts to align his portfolio with the health of the U.S. and global economy. During the second quarter, a number of tech stocks were pared down or sold in their entirety by Duquesne's investment team, including Nvidia. The 1,545.370 shares sold by Druckenmiller reduced his fund's stake in Wall Street's AI darling by roughly 88% to just 214,060 shares. On the bright side, Nvidia has maintained its monopoly like status as the preferred provider of AI-graphics processing units (GPUs) used in high-compute data centers. The analysts at TechInsights pegged Nvidia's share of GPUs shipped to enterprise data centers at 98% in 2022 and 2023. Given the persistently strong demand for the H100 and next-generation Blackwell chip, Nvidia seems unlikely to cede its top spot anytime soon. But there's another side to Nvidia's growth story that unabashed optimists and Wall Street may be overlooking. To begin with, there hasn't been a game-changing innovation for three decades that's avoided a bubble-bursting event early in its existence. In simpler terms, investors have consistently overestimated how quickly a new technology or innovation would become mainstream with consumers and/or businesses. The fact that most companies lack a well-defined game plan to generate a positive return on their AI investments is a strong clue that we're in the early stages of what's likely another bubble-bursting event. Druckenmiller might also be anticipating competitive pressures weighing on Nvidia's margins and, eventually, its bottom line. While new chips coming to market from competitors is expected, the bigger concern might be that all four of Nvidia's largest customers by net sales are developing AI-GPUs of their own. Even if Nvidia's chips are faster and more energy efficient, the ease of access and cost advantages of internally developed chips will lead to fewer opportunities for Nvidia in the future. I'd be remiss if I didn't also mention that no insiders have purchased shares of Nvidia on the open market since December 2020. This looks to be a clear signal that shares of Nvidia aren't the bargain they once were. But while Druckenmiller was dumping most of Duquesne's stake in Nvidia during the June-ended quarter, he was piling into two unstoppable companies. The first smoking-hot deal that billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller found irresistible in the second quarter is tobacco goliath   (NYSE: PM). His fund purchased 889,355 shares of Philip Morris (worth around $90.1 million, as of the midpoint of 2024), as well as call options that give Duquesne the right to purchase up to 963,000 additional shares. For years, tobacco stocks have been yesterday's news. Some developed countries have restricted the ability of tobacco companies to advertise, and consumers are now more aware of the potential dangers to their health of using tobacco products. Despite these challenges, Philip Morris's stock hit an all-time closing high in September. One catalyst that's seemingly always in the corner of tobacco stocks is their pricing power. Tobacco contains nicotine, which is an addictive chemical. This addictive quality allows tobacco companies to raise the price on their products — especially premium brands, such as Marlboro — without chasing away their customers. Thus, even with cigarette shipments declining in developed markets, revenue continues to climb. Philip Morris also enjoys unparalleled geographic diversity. This is a company with operations in 180 countries. If regulations for the tobacco industry become unfavorable in certain developed markets, Philip Morris can simply lean on emerging markets, where tobacco may still be considered a luxury item, to pick up the slack. Additionally, Philip Morris is investing for a smokeless future. The company's smoke-free business accounted for 38% of net sales during the June-ended quarter, with its IQOS heated tobacco units leading the charge. The total number of IQOS users reached 30.8 million in the second quarter (up 1.9 million from the end of 2023), with its IQOS device commanding a greater than 8% share of the heated tobacco market in countries where IQOS is sold. Although Philip Morris's stock is at the high end of its valuation range over the last decade — currently 17 times forward-year earnings — Druckenmiller's fund is likely already up between 20% and 30% on its stake. The other unstoppable stock that billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller piled into during the June-ended quarter is energy goliath   (NYSE: KMI). Duquesne's 13F shows that 2,872,665 shares of Kinder Morgan were purchased, which increased the fund's existing stake by 74% to 6,753,165 shares. Investor sentiment toward oil and gas stocks has been mixed since the COVID-19 pandemic. The historic demand cliff observed during the early stages of the pandemic clobbered drillers. However, Kinder Morgan's operations have been largely unfazed. The reason Kinder Morgan has thrived is because it's a midstream energy company. It's effectively a middleman that's responsible for transporting, storing, processing, and treating natural gas and natural gas liquids, as well as petroleum products. The beautiful thing about midstream energy companies (and Kinder Morgan is no exception) is that they primarily operate on fixed-fee contracts. Cementing long-term fixed-fee deals with drilling companies ensures that energy commodity spot-price volatility and inflation are non-factors. This leads to highly predictable operating cash flow year after year, which comes in especially handy for midstream providers. Being able to accurately forecast operating cash flow a year or more in advance is what gives Kinder Morgan's board the confidence to dole out what's currently a nearly 5% dividend yield. Further, it affords management the ability to make bolt-on acquisitions that can rapidly expand its infrastructure and add to its cash flow. Interestingly enough, the three-year stretch during the pandemic where global energy companies slashed their capital expenditures (capex) might also be a long-term positive for Kinder Morgan. Reducing capex tightened the global supply of crude oil and lifted its spot price. If the spot price for in-demand energy commodities remains high, it'll likely incent more production and afford Kinder Morgan the opportunity to land lucrative, fixed-fee contracts. Kinder Morgan is currently valued at 9.7 times forecast cash flow for 2025, which is its priciest multiple to cash flow since 2019. But with Druckenmiller's fund gaining in the neighborhood of 20% to 30% on its stake in Kinder Morgan in a couple of months, I doubt he or his investment team are complaining.

{"title": "Mixed mortgage signals: Inflation continues to cool, but the labor market strengthens", "content": "If there was any doubt that the     was the right move, those doubts are fading, and there’s reason to support another cut in the coming months. That’s because the   Consumer Price Index (CPI) for September fell by 0.1 percentage points compared to   and sits at a measured 2.4% year-over-year. Year-over-year core inflation — which omits food and energy costs — rose 3.3%, which is 0.1 percentage points higher than August. The year-over-year number for shelter costs — which is weighted a third of the index — also fell to 4.9% in September from 5.2% in August to 4.9%, and it’s down from the 8.2% peak in March 2023. Those costs account for 65% of September core inflation. “With trading markets currently pricing in two 25 bps [interest rate] cuts — one each in November and December — and continued signs that inflation is waning, it seems that markets are correctly pricing in these cuts,” said   Senior Economist Ralph McLaughlin in a statement. “As a result, we will likely see the 10-year treasury stabilize. This should lead to relatively stable mortgage rates until PCE data — the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation — are released later in the month.” Despite inflation inching to the   the CPI report sends a slightly mixed signal relative to the   which showed an added 254,000 non-farm payroll jobs in September. That number is higher than the monthly average of 203,000 added jobs over the last 12 months. Wage growth also accelerated to 4% in September. The Fed was waiting for   before cutting rates. That appeared to be happening in the runup to September, but last week’s report showed the opposite. Still, with inflation metrics continuing to cool or at least stay even, economists are optimistic that more rate cuts will happen before the end of the year. “What does all of this economic data mean for prospective homebuyers and sellers this fall?” asked   Chief Economist Lisa Sturtevant in a statement. “Lower inflation suggests that mortgage rates will come down further this fall. However, mortgage rates are impacted by broader economic conditions. If labor market conditions continue to outpace expectations, we could see mortgage rates increase or at least not fall further.

{"title": "Mortgage Rates Jump Most Since April, Sending 30-Year to 6.32%", "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Mortgage rates in the US rose for a second straight week, reaching the highest level since early September. Most Read from Bloomberg The average for a 30-year fixed loan was 6.32%, up from 6.12% last week, Freddie Mac said in a statement Thursday. It was the biggest one-week jump since April. Borrowing costs climbed along with 10-year Treasury yields, which topped 4% this week after robust September jobs data spurred traders to scale back expectations for aggressive Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts. A key measure of inflation for last month rose more then forecast, boosting bets that the Fed will opt for a smaller reduction in November. “The rise in rates is largely due to shifts in expectations and not the underlying economy, which has been strong for most of the year,” Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, said in the statement. “Although higher rates make affordability more challenging, it shows the economic strength that should continue to support the recovery of the housing market.” About 84% of current mortgages have a rate of 6% or lower, according to a recent analysis by Realtor.com. Borrowers who’ve been waiting for costs to fall below that level before listing their homes for sale and purchasing new ones — and prospective first-time buyers in search of affordability — may now find reason to hesitate even longer. But for some potential buyers, now may be a good time to act because more favorable rates may not materialize any time soon, according to Melissa Cohn, regional vice president of William Raveis Mortgage. “This is a wake-up call, saying that no, you better find a house you want to buy and then worry about rates secondly,” she said. “You cannot wait for a rate that may never exist.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek ©2024 Bloomberg L.P.", "date": "2024-10-10", "time": "16:00:00.000", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mortgage-rates-jump-most-since-160000104.html"},

{"title": "Why pro trader Tom Sosnoff says to bet on yourself instead of passive index funds", "content": "Passive investing hit a major milestone in 2023. For the first time ever,   with global assets hitting $13.3 trillion. Though 2023 saw paltry flows after the 2022 bear market, the milestone capped a decades-long trend in how money flows from investors into the markets. But Tom Sosnoff, co-founder of tastytrade and co-founder and CEO of tastylive, has made a career believing investors shouldn’t just sit back and relax in passive funds. He earned his trading chops over two decades in the trading pits and another two on trading screens and is known for his contrarian opinions. In a recent appearance on  , he asserted that set-it-and-forget-it passive investing is actually riskier than stock-picking and actively managing your money. “The problem with passive investing,” Sosnoff explained (see video above; listen below), “is that when you start passive investing when you're young — you close your eyes, take a nap, and wake up at 60 — and you don’t know how markets work.” Sosnoff believes passive investing breeds complacency and that it potentially deprives the investor of an education in risk management, market mechanics, and decision making. In contrast, active trading forces investors to think strategically, take calculated risks, and adapt to market shifts. Losses are, so to speak, tuition for an education. The irony of this position in favor of active trading is that it's seemingly at odds with the near-constant drumbeat of pro-passive investing advice (such as that dispensed most recently by this author  ). However, as William Lock, head of the international equity team at Morgan Stanley  , \"The decision to opt for passive investing is still an active decision,\" adding for emphasis, \"There are over 3 million stock indices in the world — over 50 times more indices than stocks!\" Sosnoff’s stance is clear: Betting on yourself in the market, through active participation, provides an education in real-world finance — one that might provide benefits down the road. Sosnoff also sees the volatility that scares most investors as an opportunity, musing that it's \"the only true math equation in finance. Price is not mean-reverting, but volatility is.\" For the tastytrade co-founder, learning to navigate volatility equips you with the tools to take advantage of short-term inefficiencies, especially through strategies like selling options. To be clear, beginning investors can face potentially unlimited risk by selling options. But there are also many ways investors can learn to limit that risk, bringing Sosnoff's arguments once again back to education and real-world experience in investing with an eye toward risk management. And here, Sosnoff takes a unique view of risk that sees it as overblown in finance. “Risk is something you can’t control,” he said, likening it to the unpredictability of another car hitting you. \"The only thing you can control in finance is actually what you do.\" And what you can control, he said, is position size and diversification. Keeping your size small and spreading investments across multiple assets, he argues, essentially defines and limits your risk. \"Anybody can do it,\" he assured. Sosnoff hammered home the point, saying, \"The whole concept of active trading is you learn how to make decisions. You learn how to take risk. You learn how to assess probabilities. You learn how to invest strategically if you want to. And then if you don't want to, you can always go back and passively invest.\"", "date": "2024-10-10", "time": "19:00:57.000", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-pro-trader-tom-sosnoff-says-to-bet-on-yourself-instead-of-passive-index-funds-190057935.html"},

Traditional fast-food restaurants are renowned for their speed and convenience, boasting menus filled with familiar and budget-friendly items. Their reputations for on-the-go consumption make them favored destinations for individuals and families needing a quick meal. This class of restaurants, however, is fighting the perception that their meals are unhealthy and made with inferior ingredients, a battle that's especially relevant today given the consumers increasing focus on health and wellness. A company’s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall business quality. While any business can experience short-term success, top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for multiple years. Domino's is one of the larger restaurant chains in the industry and benefits from a well-known brand that influences consumer purchasing decisions. However, its scale is a double-edged sword because it's harder to find incremental growth when you've already penetrated the market. As you can see below, Domino’s 5.6% annualized revenue growth over the last five years (we compare to 2019 to normalize for COVID-19 impacts) was tepid, but to its credit, it opened new restaurants and increased sales at existing, established dining locations. This quarter, Domino’s revenue grew 5.1% year on year to $1.08 billion, missing Wall Street’s estimates. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect sales to grow 7.4% over the next 12 months, an acceleration versus the last five years. Here at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing.

So, in that spirit, we’ve identified  . A company’s same-store sales growth shows the year-on-year change in sales for its restaurants that have been open for at least a year, give or take. This is a key performance indicator because it measures organic growth and demand. Domino’s demand within its existing restaurants has been relatively stable over the last eight quarters but fell behind the broader sector. On average, the company’s same-store sales have grown by 2.3% year on year. With positive same-store sales growth amid an increasing number of restaurants, Domino's is reaching more diners and growing sales. In the latest quarter, Domino’s same-store sales rose 3% year on year. This growth was an acceleration from the 1.3% year-on-year increase it posted 12 months ago, which is always an encouraging sign. It was good to see Domino's beat analysts’ EPS expectations this quarter. On the other hand, its revenue unfortunately missed analysts’ expectations. Another disappointing dynamic was guidance, with the company calling for 6% global retail sales growth, which slightly missed expectations. Overall, this quarter could have been better. The stock remained flat at $412.98 immediately after reporting. Domino's underperformed this quarter, but does that create an opportunity to invest right now?When making that decision, it’s important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. .", "date": "2024-10-10", "time": "10:18:24.000", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dominos-nyse-dpz-reports-sales-101824438.html"},

The execs predict the Brentwood, Tennessee-based company could sell for roughly $600 million, or 12 times Celero’s trailing Ebitda of $50 million. Celero is in the “back half’ of a process that has attracted private equity, they said. LLR, a lower middle market PE firm, formed Celero in late 2018 when it  in UMS Banking, a merchant acquirer. Celero has remained very acquisitive,  about 10 companies since then, including RazorSync in 2019,  in 2020, and this past August, it scooped up SONA.

The number of U.S. announced transactions so far this year has dropped about 8% to 7,993, totaling $1.2 trillion as of Oct. 7, according to data from Dealogic. That figure represents a 17% jump in value compared to 2023 when 8,660 mergers totaled $1 trillion, according to Dealogic. While there are lots of discussions going on, sales are harder to get done this year, one fintech banker said. Mergers typically slow down ahead of the U.S. presidential election with many expecting deals to return next year. “Buyers aren’t ready to spend on these M&A situations as easily as they used to in the past. That’s the issue,” one banker said. In another fintech development, Finexio, the payments startup backed by JPMorgan, is seeking a minority round of capital, according to three banking sources. Finexio has hired an investment bank to advise on the fundraise, they said.

Here's Both The Income And Net Worth You Need to Rank Among The Wealthiest", "content": "The phrase \"the one percent\" gets tossed around a lot in conversations about wealth and inequality, whether in politics, protests, or everyday chats. But what does it mean to be in the top 1%? Let's break it down by income and net worth to get a clearer picture of  To be in the   in the U.S., a household must bring in at least $591,550 a year. For a single individual, the cutoff is $407,500. Remember, these numbers are averages and can vary depending on where you live. For example, earning that much in New York City might not stretch as far as it does in other parts of the country. The high cost of living, driven by expensive housing, taxes, and everyday expenses, means that a six-figure salary might only cover basic needs in the city. In contrast, in regions with a lower cost of living, such as the Midwest or South, the same income can offer a more comfortable lifestyle with more discretionary spending power. When it comes to net worth, the threshold is even higher. To be part of the top 1% in the U.S., a household's net worth needs to be at least $13.6 million. This measure includes everything you own – homes, investments, savings – minus debts. Wealth tends to be a lot more unevenly distributed than income. Many households have little to no net worth, while the top tier sits on massive wealth. That's why net worth often gives a clearer picture of someone's financial status than income alone. So, which is more important, income or net worth? It depends on what you're trying to measure. Income is great for understanding how much someone earns in a year, but net worth is the better gauge for long-term financial stability and overall wealth. Someone with a high income might not have a high net worth if they spend a lot or have significant debt, while someone with a lower income but solid investments could be much wealthier. As of the latest numbers, there are around 1.3 million households and about 1.8 million individual workers who fall into the top 1% in the U.S. That's a small slice of the population but represents a significant share of the country's wealth and income. to the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), the income required to be in the top 1% varies significantly across states.For example: Connecticut has the highest threshold at $952,902 New York follows at $880,000 California comes in third at $805,000 On the lower end, West Virginia at $347,712 Understanding   isn't just about how much you earn right now but also what you've built over time.

{"title": "Milton’s Surprise Was the Damage Unleashed by Powerful Winds", "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Hurricane Milton’s devastating path across Florida has left at least 10 dead, millions without power, and destroyed homes and crops, as authorities warn it could take days to assess the full extent of the damages. Most Read from Bloomberg Milton delivered a quick, hard blow to the center of the state, tearing across the peninsula in just a few hours before racing back out to sea. The storm surge that swamped Florida’s west coast on Wednesday was about half as high as forecasters had feared. Landing just outside Sarasota, Milton’s 120 mile per hour winds (193 kilometers per hour) even pushed water out of Tampa Bay and into the Gulf, rather than inundating surrounding cities. Instead, much of the worst damage — a crane tossed into a St. Petersburg building, the shredded roof of the Tropicana Field sports stadium — came from wind rather than water. “The storm was significant, but thankfully, this was not the worst-case scenario,” Governor Ron DeSantis said at a Thursday press conference. In a dangerous twist, Milton’s wind shear and thunderstorms in the hours before landfall triggered a severe tornado outbreak on the eastern side of the state. At least 38 tornado reports came into the US Storm Prediction Center, many of them from along the Interstate 95 corridor, near Palm Beach and St. Lucie. The exact number of tornadoes remains to be seen. “There’s some really extensive damage, like roofs ripped off,” said Luke Culver, a National Weather Service meteorologist. Culver said the tornadoes were spawned by conditions in Milton’s dry, southeast quadrant, which extended hundreds of miles inland. “There’s a very high amount of shear in that quadrant of the hurricane,” he said, “and that shear causes thunderstorms to begin rotating, which is what eventually leads to a tornado.” Milton’s brief rampage stood in marked contrast to Hurricane Helene, which struck the state just two weeks earlier. Helene drenched parts of the southeastern US with heavy rain for days, both before and after landfall, triggering floods and killing more than 230 people. Less than 24 hours after Milton’s landfall, the storm that dropped 18.75 inches (48 centimeters) of water on St. Petersburg was a spent post-tropical cyclone over the Atlantic, speeding away from shore. The full scope of Milton’s destruction won’t be known for days or perhaps weeks. The death toll stood at 10, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said during a briefing on Thursday. That number could rise as search-and-rescue efforts continue. Many of the 80,000 people who fled to government shelters to ride out the storm will return to destroyed homes. The Tampa Bay Rays baseball team, whose stadium roof was torn off by the storm, said in a statement it would assess damage in the coming weeks. Utilities are inspecting power lines and plants, many of which lay in the direct path of the storm. About 2.6 million homes and businesses remain without electricity in Florida, according to poweroutage.us. Utility service provider Duke Energy Florida said it would on Friday issue estimated times of power restoration to all customers impacted by the storm. Losses may reach $60 billion to $75 billion, said Chuck Watson, a disaster modeler with Enki Research. AccuWeather put the cost much higher at $160 billion to $180 billion. President Joe Biden promised swift action and urged Congress to ensure the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Small Business Administration — already dealing with Helene’s aftermath — have the resources needed. “Congress should be coming back and moving on emergency needs immediately,” Biden said at a press conference. He also warned against scammers or price-gougers trying to take advantage of the disaster. Some businesses seemed poised to bounce back quickly. Comcast Corp.’s Orlando theme parks will reopen Friday and the Universal CityWalk mall may reopen Thursday night, Chief Executive Officer Brian Roberts said at Bloomberg’s Screentime conference in Los Angeles. “As soon as power’s back, we’ll be back,” Roberts said. Meanwhile, Walt Disney Co.’s World Resort “weathered the storm,” and the company is preparing to reopen the theme park Friday, a spokesperson wrote in an email. SeaWorld Orlando will also reopen Friday, according to a company statement. Some commercial ports in Florida were reopened on Thursday following Milton’s passage, the US Coast Guard said in a statement. At least seven ports in Florida remain closed, including St. Petersburg, Jacksonville, and Fort Myers. Port Tampa Bay, one of the busiest US maritime gateways for fertilizer exports, said it was without power but had found “no significant damage to docks, so far.” The port, as well as the nearby Port Manatee, have reopened with some restrictions to vessel movements, according to the US Coast Guard. Fertilizer producer Mosaic Co., which had idled its Florida operations ahead of Milton’s arrival, said in a statement on Thursday that it was working to confirm the safety of its employees and will “begin assessing the impact on our operations” when conditions allow. Trevor Murphy, a citrus grower in Highlands County, said he “lost a decent amount of the early crop,” which was fewer than 60 days out from harvest. Valencia oranges from the main crop didn’t fall off the trees as much but there is “still a decent amount on the ground,” Murphy said, adding that fruits will continue to drop over the next one to two weeks. In addition to damaged crops and power blackouts, Floridians will have to deal with residual flooding, some of it tainted with sewage. Millions of gallons of raw and partially treated sewage have flowed into streets and rivers as floodwater swamped infrastructure and power outages knocked pumps offline. The city of Leesburg’s wastewater treatment plant, for example, spilled nearly 2 million gallons of untreated sewage, according to a filing with the state’s Department of Environmental Protection. The city of St. Petersburg, which had shut off drinking water due to major water main breaks from Milton, has restored potable water supply but a citywide boil water advisory will remain in place until Monday Oct. 14. Homeowners, meanwhile, are assessing damage to roofs and windows, and helping neighbors as they can. Greg Cruz, a 49-year-old in Sarasota, rode out Milton at his home, which is in a mandatory evacuation zone. He said he didn’t have a place to go with his three kids, ages 19, 16 and 14, and his dog. “We had the house boarded up, so we couldn’t see outside, and all you could hear is the battering of the wind,” he said. --With assistance from Michael Smith, Alex Newman, Ilena Peng, Brendan Murray, Ari Natter, Tope Alake, Josh Saul, Zahra Hirji, Michelle Ma, Brian K.

{"title": "Bank of Korea Pivots With Rate Cut as Property Market Cools", "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Korea cut its benchmark interest rate after local property markets showed signs of cooling and inflationary pressure eased sharply, allowing authorities to finally shift their focus to supporting economic activity. Most Read from Bloomberg The central bank lowered its seven-day repurchase rate by a quarter-percentage-point to 3.25% in a decision predicted by 20 of 22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The other two expected the bank to maintain the rate at 3.5% to help rein in home prices that risk spurring more household debt. With its policy pivot the BOK joins a growing wave of central banks changing course to embark on easing cycles in a bid to revive economic momentum now that inflationary pressure has cooled. The Federal Reserve last month cut its key rate by a half-percentage point as ensuring a soft landing for the economy took precedence over its inflation battle. “The rate cut not only responds to the consumption that’s been lackluster, but also shows the BOK can afford to loosen a bit given the pressure pushing the inflation rate back above 2% appears limited,” said Ahn Yea-ha, analyst at Kiwoom Securities Co. Ahn still forecasts a gradual easing with the BOK holding the rate in November. Until Friday, the BOK had held the rate at a restrictive 3.5% for more than a year and a half. Policymakers extended the holding pattern in recent months on concerns that any early signals of a pivot might further fuel a rebound in the housing market and threaten financial stability. The rate cut reflects concerns over stagnant private spending and credit risks related to the construction industry. With most borrowers on floating rates, interest expenses have exerted a drag on consumption, prompting some lawmakers to call for the central bank to cut rates. “Given the prevailing negative sentiment and the Fed’s sizable cut, the market expects faster rate cuts by the BOK to support economic growth and momentum,” Standard Chartered Bank economists Chong Hoon Park and Nicholas Chia said in a note before the decision. “Still, we think negative sentiment on Korea’s economy is overblown, and the BOK is likely to stay cautious on cutting the base rate aggressively as it weighs the risks to financial stability.” What Bloomberg Economics Says... “With rising home prices in Seoul and growing debt remaining a key concern, we expect this easing cycle to proceed only gradually. Our baseline view is the BOK will hold rates at its November meeting, then resume cuts in the first quarter of 2025.” — Hyosung Kwon, economist For the full report, click here The government has sought to rein in housing markets with a pledge to increase home supplies and by rolling out stronger regulations on mortgage loans, moves that may have reassured the central bank that the market would cool. One BOK board member cited those measures in the lead-up to Friday’s decision. “Monetary easing on a measured pace could also help engineer a soft landing of property markets in a close coordination with financial regulators,” Goldman Sachs analysts Goohoon Kwon and Andrew Tilton said in a note. With moderating export growth and other potential headwinds to the economy, the BOK will likely conduct a quarter-point cut each quarter until the rate reaches 2.5% by the third quarter of next year, they projected. Governor Rhee Chang-yong will hold a press conference later Friday to address questions over the future trajectory of rate policy. In addition to disclosing how many board members dissented from the latest decision, the governor is likely to outline expectations among board members for rates over the next three months. Factors that will help strengthen speculation over another cut include lukewarm spending by consumers, credit risks that undermined investment in the construction industry and geopolitical uncertainties such as US-China trade tensions and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. South Korea’s gross domestic product shrank unexpectedly in the second quarter after a stronger-than-expected expansion at the start of 2024. Declines in investment weighed on economic activity with elevated borrowing costs and uncertain consumption outlooks hurting sentiment. Still, policymakers have downplayed the slip in growth largely as temporary.

{"title": "Why strong earnings and cash flow are key to navigating value traps", "content": "The S&P 500 ( ) has been riding a high lately, with the 5,800 mark clear in sight. That leaves some investors feeling a bit anxious, as the current index level implies a   that's a bit on the expensive side, historically. “When I look at a P/E ratio today of 24 times, it makes me a little nervous,\" said Michaella Gallina on a recent episode of   (see video above; listen below). Gallina has a unique perspective on the market. She began her career on the  , then leaped into  . She now serves as both the CFO of the consultancy group Wave HQ and as vice president of investor relations at H&R Block ( ) — where she has transformed corporate communications, facilitating a 191% appreciation in stock price over her brief tenure at the tax preparation company. It’s easy for investors to get caught up in the hype around high-growth  , said Gallina, who cautions against chasing moonshots. “There’s been a lot of hoopla around some [of the] unicorns that we're seeing with tremendous growth,\" she observed, adding, \"If you want to beat the market, you need to play with what's in the game.\" In general, that means focusing on companies that offer long-term stability and reliable performance, rather than chasing the latest trend or speculative opportunity. But the quest for value over growth is easier said than done. Gallina noted that any market frenzy (and there's usually  ) can lead investors to look for stocks that may be cheap but that have fundamental flaws, leaving them with little hope of ever going anywhere. These stocks are called  . \"Price is what you pay. Value is what you get,\" wrote legendary investor Warren Buffett in a letter to partners in 1966. In Buffett and partner Charlie Munger's classic aphorism, it's far better to \"buy a wonderful company at a fair price than an average company for cheap.\" And in a market where  , Gallina’s focus on value stocks becomes even more critical. Stock picking has never been easy, but in today’s market fueled by a bazooka of alternative and traditional media sources, it’s arguably harder than ever. According to a   by Morningstar of the stock-picking records of active managers over a decade, only 44% of professional stock-pickers beat their benchmarks. But more importantly — and dangerously — they struggled to size their positions effectively. The study found, in part, that the   is not struggling to find more winners, but \"rather in sizing them in a manner that leads to outperformance,\" wrote Morningstar senior manager Jack Shannon. “The ground that active managers’ winners gain often cannot make up for what their laggards lose. Of course, higher fees don’t help, either,\" said Shannon, referring to the relatively high commission structure still found in fund management. (The historical standard is a 2% management fee and 20% incentive fee — still charged in many cases.) For Gallina, value follows the Buffett model in not looking for cheap stocks but in identifying companies with steady and growing profits and cash flows. She's looking for “strong, consistent earnings and cash flow over time that you can predict and is stable.\" These qualities provide a potential safeguard against the wild swings behind so many growth stories in today’s market. The reality is that many companies that look promising on the surface don’t hold up to scrutiny. “I think if most investors got a peek behind the curtain, they would find most companies completely uninvestable,\" said Gallina, which brings up a separate (but related issue) of the difficulty in corporate communications with investors. Gallina invests with a very long-term view, aiming for steady gains with low volatility. “We’re not flashy, but we’re consistent,” she said of H&R Block stock which has soared 191% in her three years directing their corporate communications. For her, this is proof that steady, predictable companies are the true winners in the market, even if they don’t grab the headlines. She relates it to her side gig as an equestrian, saying, “Riding a 1,200-pound animal teaches you a lot about grit. In the ring, there’s no one coming to save you.

Smith said he’d buy baseball and women’s basketball, but sell golf and boxing. Most Read from Bloomberg New rules speeding up baseball make it more fun for fans, and women’s basketball is seeing a surge in viewers thanks to Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark, he said Thursday at the Bloomberg Screentime conference. Boxing, Smith said, is one he would sell. “The promoters have ruined the sport,” Smith said. “They need somebody like (UFC chief) Dana White overseeing the sport. So you can give us the fights we want to see, when we want to see them, as opposed to dudes being able to avoid one another because they might get knocked out.” Golf is a sell, too, despite Tiger Woods’ success in what was historically an all-White sport. “There is nothing about golf that says to me, I’m invited, nothing,” said Smith, who is Black. “It costs a boatload of money to be a member of the club. You got to buy your golf clubs. It’s at a country club that, you know, the only time you really, really see Black folks, they’re working there.” Smith, 56, is one of the best known personalities on ESPN, serving as the featured commentator and executive producer of the weekday morning show First Take and as an analyst on NBA Countdown. He also hosts his own show on ESPN’s radio network. The network, which is owned by Walt Disney Co. and Hearst Corp., is suffering like other traditional TV companies as consumers cancel cable-TV subscriptions and shift to streaming services. As a result, ESPN has been in cost-cutting mode in recent years, with several high-profile personalities departing. Last month, one of the network’s highest-paid stars, NBA reporter Adrian Wojnarowski, announced he was retiring. Smith has reportedly been looking for as much as $25 million annually in a new contract, twice what he’s currently making. He said he prefers to stay as ESPN and wants to reach a deal with the network. “And so now a negotiation takes place and hopefully the two sides can come to an accord,” he said. “And if we can’t, we can’t.

While most don’t expect a fully functional robotaxi that can be deployed right away, it’s what CEO Elon Musk and Tesla can do to paint a picture of autonomous self-driving that the company envisions for the next five or 10 years down the road that matters. Possible   suggesting Tesla may strike a robo-delivery deal with DoorDash, for instance. (Yahoo Finance could not verify those reports.) Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley, who named Tesla his “top pick” in the autos space, has nonetheless advised clients to “keep expectations well managed” for the event. What will most likely be on display is a demonstration of the latest iteration of Full Self-Driving (FSD) software and a demonstration of a fully autonomous \"cybercab\" in a closed or semi-closed course, Jonas wrote last month. But in a more recent note last week, Jonas said investors may hear more about how those cybercabs, or robotaxis, will be deployed. “It is our expectation that Tesla will offer a 'dual' approach with respect to autonomous ridesharing: (1) the fully autonomous app-based cybercab and (2) a 'supervised' autonomous/FSD rideshare service. We think the latter of these may get the most attention or have the greatest room to surprise investors, at least near term,” Jonas said. While the cybercab — a vehicle envisioned as one without a steering wheel or pedals — may be the natural fit for a robotaxi, Jonas believes it is the preexisting fleet of Teslas out on the road that, when combined with FSD and Tesla’s upcoming rideshare mobility app, will allow owners of those Tesla EVs to put those vehicles on Tesla’s rideshare service. The true game changer would be unlocking the potential of those vehicles, he said. A Tesla deal with DoorDash to deliver restaurant takeout could easily be envisioned as part of this service. Jonas and Morgan Stanley have an Overweight rating and a $310 price target on Tesla heading into the event. Other analysts believe that the cybercab unveiled could actually be the model or basis for a new Tesla passenger vehicle, the long-promised  . “For Robotaxi Day on Oct. 10, we expect an unveiling of the ‘CyberCab’ at the venue, [and] some type of robotaxi demo … Moreover, Tesla should unveil the new lower cost vehicle slated for SOP [start of production] next year (“Model 2” or cheaper/smaller Model 3 variant),” Deutsche Bank’s Edison Yu wrote in a note. Yu is referring to the sub-$30K next-gen EV Tesla confirmed would be coming later this year, one that would open up new buyers to the Tesla universe. Yu, who has a Buy rating and a $295 price target on Tesla, is also advising clients to be “tactically cautious” on the event, as the bar for wowing the Street is high and the likelihood of a “sell the news” type of reaction is possible. Garrett Nelson of CFRA also believes that a cheaper Tesla EV will be coming alongside the cybercab. While he thinks Tesla plans to create a robotaxi fleet harnessing the cybercab and other Tesla EVs powered by FSD software, he is skeptical of how realistic timing will be for this venture. “We think this [robotaxi fleet] is still several years away and numerous technological hurdles, safety tests, and regulatory approvals are still standing in the way,” Nelson wrote last week. Nelson believes Tesla “remains far from achieving a level of autonomy” that would include capabilities like performing all safety-critical driving functions and monitoring road conditions for an entire trip. Nelson, who has a Hold rating and $240 price target on Tesla, believes the key question for Tesla’s bull case is whether or not investors will give the company a pass on near- and intermediate-term issues, such as softer EV sales, and continue to focus more on longer-term opportunities like autonomous driving and robotaxi deployment. Finally, in a note published late last week, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives believes Thursday’s event will put Tesla’s long-term vision on full display. While Ives and other analysts believe Tesla will showcase the cybercab, its next-gen platform, and FSD and AI updates, Ives predicts Musk will also address the “near-term pain points” seen by investors for self-driving and how the company will overcome them. Ives added that Tesla, for which Wedbush has an Outperform rating and bullish $300 price target, is going through another transformation not seen since the company's volume Model 3 and Y release, with the next phase focused on AI, FSD, and supercomputing. He believes this phase represents $1 trillion in value alone. “We firmly believe that Tesla remains a robotics/AI play in the future rather than just an EV vendor,” Ives said. “We believe this is a pivotal time for Tesla as the company prepares to release its years of Robotaxi R&D shadowed behind the curtains, while Musk & Co. lay out the company’s vision for the future.”", "date": "2024-10-10", "time": "16:47:49.000", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-robotaxi-event-analysts-weigh-in-on-what-to-expect-from-ceo-elon-musks-big-moment-164748104.html"},

Super Micro is reportedly being   over allegations of shady business practices outlined in a scathing   by short seller firm Hindenburg Research in late August. That has pressured the stock, which has hovered under $50 per share since then. This week, SMCI climbed on positive reports from the AI server maker. Super Micro surged 16% Monday after the company released numbers showing strong demand for its products. The stock was up 12% on Thursday from the prior week. Super Micro makes servers using Nvidia's ( ) AI chips for data centers that power artificial intelligence software. The company said it’s   “for some of the largest AI factories ever built.” Then on Tuesday, shares of SMCI fell 5% after a   that saw the stock jump as much as 7%. Daniel Newman, CEO of the Futurum Group, said investors’ euphoria over the company’s shipment data faded against the backdrop of Super Micro’s regulatory risk. “I think one piece of good news hardly undoes multiple months of significant financial and regulatory scrutiny around a company like this,” Newman said. The Hindenburg report in August accused Super Micro of shoddy accounting, undisclosed relationships between its CEO and companies it does business with, and violations of US export bans. For example, Hindenburg said Super Micro has shipped servers to sanctioned Russian firms through shell companies, some of which were likely used by its military for its war against Ukraine. The day after Hindenburg released its report, Super Micro shares dropped 20%. The company also delayed filing its annual 10-K report to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Super Micro’s woes continued with a Wall Street Journal report of an alleged DOJ probe, which sent shares tumbling in late September. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang said the Hindenburg report contained “false or inaccurate statements” and “misleading presentations of information that we have previously shared publicly.” Liang said the company’s delayed 10-K filing would not affect the company’s fourth quarter financial results, adding that Super Micro would address Hindenburg’s allegations “in due course.” Super Micro’s stock climb this week displays the tension between its potential as a key player in the AI boom and its regulatory hurdles. “This is a high-risk reward,” Newman said. “If they get absolved of all of this, there's a very good chance it's going to see a pretty nice move to the upside.” Of the Wall Street analysts tracked by Bloomberg who are covering the stock, seven have a Buy rating on the stock, while 11 maintain a Hold rating. Only one analyst recommends selling the stock. Analysts see shares rising to $66 over the next 12 months. The company reported mixed results in its last earnings report. Super Micro’s most recent quarterly revenue of $5.3 billion for the three months ended June 30 barely missed Wall Street’s expectations, but was 143% higher than the prior year. On the other hand, Super Micro's earnings per share for the company’s fiscal fourth quarter of $0.63 were far lower than analysts’ consensus forecast of $0.83, according to Bloomberg data. Argus Research analyst Jim Kelleher told investors in a note on Oct. 3 to buy the dip, noting that Super Micro “has been growing sales and earnings much more rapidly than the Tech industry in recent years.” Wall Street expects Super Micro to report revenues of $6.5 billion for the period ended Sept. 30, up 206% from the previous year. The company has not yet confirmed a date for its next earnings release. “At this point, we are assuming that any accounting irregularities should they exist are minor and can be addressed while requiring re-issued financial documents,” Kelleher said, adding that Super Micro’s recent 10-for-1 stock split on Oct. 1 “broadens the potential investor pool and should be a long-term positive.” Despite his long-term optimism, Kelleher lowered his 12-month price target for the stock from $100 to $70.", "date": "2024-10-10", "time": "20:13:40.000", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/super-micro-computer-stock-continues-wild-ride-as-investors-weigh-ai-hype-against-alleged-doj-probe-170756142.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9maW5hbmNlLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzLw&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEVfPVEASIT_EVG7Ar3pZP3EFIb7yCyfXZREkyo7-1b5dWIKzVBmgjFfwhaeKV7SIkNetwpNNPgFLPMpbl6g0kuXE7b5o0zS7FnvNfVKfAzP9AyUzqS8og85cBkWxxDWYZgvueIRl4OBSgE41R2jbhZsfZjOCCOPPu-qJObxPy9V"},

Five out of the six food groups the   monitors saw price increases from August to September. Food at home inflation was led by the meats, poultry, fish, and eggs category, which saw a 0.8% increase compared to the month prior. Egg prices, in particular, climbed 8.4% on a monthly basis and were up a whopping 39.6% compared to September of last year. Cereal and bakery products also grew 0.3% month over month, led by higher prices for rice, pasta, and cornmeal, up 1.3%, along with increases for cakes, cupcakes, and cookies, up 1.2%. Fruit and vegetables also saw a 0.9% monthly increase, led by the cost of citrus fruits, which was up 1.9%. This jump comes after a 0.2% monthly decline in August, and higher prices will likely stick around after Florida orange groves were hit by extreme weather. \"The orange groves down there obviously got flooded,\" Stew Leonard Jr., CEO of Stew Leonard's, told Yahoo Finance. \"They said it wasn't as bad as they thought it was, but still, there's going to be a little supply disruption.\" Leonard said other factors driving prices higher include the cost of labor, the port strike, and the ongoing war in Ukraine.

Prices for sugar and sweets increased 0.8% on a yearly basis, boosted by sugar and sugar substitutes, which were up 3.3% from last year, while candy and chewing gum increased just 0.3%. On a monthly basis, the category is down 0.7%. While the CPI print showed signs of relief, rising cocoa prices could still drive candy prices higher. Year to date, the price of cocoa futures ( ) has nearly doubled as the result of the El Niño climate pattern, which led to a lower supply of cocoa production, David Branch of Wells Fargo said. Crop production is down 14.2% on an annual basis for the 2023-2024 crop year, he said, resulting in a 405,000 metric ton deficit and bringing the total global cocoa supply deficit to 462,000 metric tons. Branch said candy makers have worked around this by adding \"more filler\" to candy. \"Your pure chocolate candies probably have gotten smaller or [there] is going to be less produced,\" he said. Candies that already have other ingredients like almonds are likely to have more too, since it'll be \"a lot cheaper than the cocoa.\" Branch pointed out that consumer packaged goods companies are also offering different shapes of candy or gummy offerings to keep prices lower.

Although the banks are borrowing more this year, they are really getting back to a normal level of bond issuance since the Federal Reserve stopped raising interest rates last year, and more recently began cutting them. “It is reasonable to expect bank new issuance post-earnings and pre-election,” said Nicholas Elfner, co-head of research at Breckinridge Capital Advisors. “With tight spreads and the prospect for Fed cuts, we think supply should normalize in the quarters ahead.” Big banks always need fresh funds for their own lending and as the biggest borrowers in the US investment-grade market, they are known to be savvy about when to borrow. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Arnold Kakuda says the banks are getting ahead of potential volatility around the US elections in November and taking advantage of borrowing costs that are near a 20-year low amid strong investor demand. He estimates the “Big Six” will complete at least $15 billion to $20 billion of sales. “The lenders may be strategic and issue above these levels to quench the voracious thirst of bond investors for corporate debt,” said Kakuda. Banks typically issue debt after reporting quarterly results, which kick off on Friday morning with JPMorgan and Wells Fargo & Co. Next week, Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are scheduled to report on Tuesday, followed by Morgan Stanley on Wednesday. Moody’s Ratings expects the big banks to report strong third-quarter trading revenue and improvements in investment banking compared with the year-ago period — thanks in part to record corporate debt issuance and an increase in equity issuance. All eyes will be glued to forecasts for full-year net interest income, which measures the difference between what a bank collects on loans and pays out to depositors. It is the biggest revenue source for traditional lenders, so any hints of what they can deliver in 2025 as the Fed is expected to keep cutting rates will be important. The broader banking industry faces some credit concerns, especially smaller lenders with commercial real estate exposure. The proportion of banks with negative ratings outlooks has risen, with several negative actions last year after a string of regional-bank failures, according to S&P Global Ratings. Still, most banks enjoy stable outlooks and regulatory tightening since the regional crisis has been a credit positive, S&P analysts including Stuart Plesser wrote in a Sept. 27 note. In addition to bank bond issuance expected this month, JPMorgan’s Caprihan predicts another $30 billion to $40 billion of new bank debt to hit the market from November through January. Voya Investment Management will be one of the investors looking to buy, according to Samuel Wilson, portfolio manager at the firm. He views banks as a rare bright spot in a market where corporate bond spreads are so tight that investors must scour for opportunities where the risks are worth the slim rewards. US investment-grade spreads averaged 82 basis points as of Wednesday’s close, according to Bloomberg index data, the tightest level since September 2021. “In the context of a tight market, it’s still a trade that we like,” Wilson said in a phone interview Wednesday.

{"title": "2 Monster Stocks to Hold for the Next 20 Years", "content": "For some investors, it's not enough to put all their money in an index fund and watch and wait as it generates a good (roughly average) return. These investors are looking for above-average returns from just one company (or a couple of companies) that they hope will be enough to measurably improve their financial situation in retirement. Most investors should strive to have a well-balanced and diverse portfolio, but almost every investment strategy can also benefit from incorporating a handful of well-chosen growth stocks. The trick, of course, is finding the right growth stocks to invest in. Here are two promising growth stocks you could buy now and comfortably hold for the next 20 years.    was one of the best-performing stocks over the past decade -- it has climbed by about 15,300% since its 2010 initial public offering. While the shares have been range-bound for the last few years, there are still opportunities ahead for the company that could fuel more returns. CEO Elon Musk doesn't see Tesla as strictly an electric car manufacturer -- he also (and perhaps more importantly) sees it as an   company. The EV market is projected to grow in the years to come, and Tesla should grow its automotive revenue along with it. However, Musk's vision for the company is much bigger. Tesla has spent years investing in its Dojo supercomputer, which serves as the AI backbone for the company's developments in self-driving cars, robotics, and more. The company also is making headway toward the rollout of its Optimus humanoid robot, which is designed to be able to perform a wide array of repetitive tasks. It's still a work in progress, but Musk has said the robot has the potential to exceed the value of any other product at Tesla. Tesla generated $78 billion in automotive revenue over the last year, but the value of the AI-powered transportation market alone is projected to reach $2.2 trillion by 2030, according to Statista. That reflects a huge opportunity for Tesla's robotaxi initiative. Tesla offers investors a lot of upside optionality across EVs and other AI-related products.   has had several successes with his business endeavors over the years (as well as his shares of failures) and he is one of the richest people in the world as a result.  Investors can invest in Tesla and tag along with his future plans for what could become the most valuable company in the world one day. Another forward-thinking company with enormous potential is    . It is laying the groundwork to expand urban short-hop air travel in the U.S. and abroad -- a market that is projected to explode. Major cities have growing needs that urban air travel can help them address, such as decreasing traffic on congested highways and decreasing travel time between urban destinations, especially to underserved areas. Moreover, the development of electric propulsion systems is providing cities with new options for reducing air pollution, and this is a huge opportunity for Archer. Archer is not generating revenue yet, as it is still in the process of gaining FAA certifications for its electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, the Midnight, but it's already delivered its first aircraft to the U.S. Air Force and is seeing strong interest from customers around the world. It recently received an order for a planned purchase of 116 aircraft from Future Flight Global, which added to Archer's $6 billion order book. Archer already has plans to launch eVTOL travel networks in Los Angeles and San Francisco. It also has a partnership with   to develop an air taxi service using the Midnight. The urban air mobility market was valued at $2.5 billion in 2022, according to Grand View Research, but is projected to grow at a 34% annualized rate through 2030. With Archer's market cap at just $1 billion, investors could see phenomenal returns over the next 20 years. Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Ingka Group, which owns most IKEA stores globally, reported 39.6 billion euros ($43.3 billion) in sales for its financial year ended Aug. 31. \"In all our markets we experienced a slowdown of the economy and a slowdown of the home furnishing industry, almost simultaneously,\" said Jesper Brodin, CEO of Ingka Group. \"We never experienced anything like that since 2008, to be honest.\" After seeing a decline in store visits and sold quantities, IKEA decided to cut prices, which boosted footfall and the amount of products sold, Brodin said. Ingka Group said it invested more than 2.1 billion euros in price cuts across its markets, and its share of the global home furnishing market stayed steady at 5.7%. IKEA has benefited from households trading down as a global property slowdown hurt confidence, said Tolga Oncu, retail manager at Ingka Group. For 2025, IKEA expects a boost to sales as lower interest rates drive more people to move house, which usually prompts buying of beds, sofas, and bookcases. Store visits increased by 3.3% to 727 million this year, slower than the 7.4% growth seen in 2023 and new openings fell to 41, from 60. Ingka plans 58 new locations worldwide in its 2025 financial year. Its share of sales made online increased to 28%, up from 26% in 2023. NOT GOING OUT AT CHRISTMAS This holiday season, like last year, Oncu expects people to spend more time hosting at home rather than going out, with budgets still constrained by inflation. Inter IKEA Group, which owns the IKEA brand and manufactures the products, reported annual sales of 45.1 billion euros ($49.3 billion) across all franchisees, of which Ingka Group is the biggest. That was down 5.3% compared to 2023, largely due to price cuts as the cost of raw materials like wood fell. Inter IKEA CEO Jon Abrahamsson Ring said more price reductions were planned for its 2025 financial year, which started on Sept. 1, but likely not as significant.

{"title": "Oil eases though investors wary over potential Mideast supply disruption", "content": "By Yuka Obayashi TOKYO (Reuters) - Oil eased on Friday after a rally the previous day, but prices remained set for a second straight weekly gain as investors weighed the impact of hurricane damage on U.S. demand against any broad supply disruption if Israel attacks Iranian oil sites. Brent crude oil futures fell 39 cents, or 0.5%, to $79.01 a barrel by 0152 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures dropped 32 cents, or 0.4%, to $75.53 per barrel. For the week, both benchmarks were headed for a 1%-2% gain. In the United States, Hurricane Milton plowed into the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday after cutting a destructive path across Florida, killing at least 10 people and leaving millions without power. The destruction could dampen fuel consumption in some areas of the world's largest oil producer and consumer. \"Investors are evaluating how hurricane damage might impact the U.S. economy and fuel demand,\" said Hiroyuki Kikukawa, president of NS Trading, a unit of Nissan Securities. \"Oil prices are likely to hover around the current 200-day average levels, with the primary concern being whether Israel will retaliate against Iranian oil facilities,\" he said. The 200-day average for Brent is at $81.68 a barrel and for WTI it's at $77.36. Crude benchmarks spiked this month after Iran launched more than 180 missiles against Israel on Oct. 1, raising the prospect of retaliation against Iranian oil facilities. Israel has yet to respond, and crude benchmarks have eased and remained relatively flat through the week. Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, however, has said that any strike against Iran would be \"lethal, precise and surprising\". Iran is backing several groups fighting Israel, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza and the Houthis in Yemen. In Lebanon, Israeli strikes on central Beirut on Thursday night killed 22 people and wounded at least 117, Lebanon's health ministry said. Lebanese security sources said at least one senior Hezbollah figure was also targeted in the attacks. Gulf states, meanwhile, are lobbying Washington to stop Israel from attacking Iran's oil sites, out of concern their own oil facilities could come under fire from Tehran's proxies if the conflict escalates, three Gulf sources told Reuters. On the supply side, Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) said on Thursday it has restored production close to levels before the country's central bank crisis, reaching 1.22 million barrels per day.

{"title": "AMD debuts latest AI chips as it battles rivals Nvidia, Intel", "content": "AMD ( ) debuted its latest artificial intelligence chips during its Advancing AI 2024 event in San Francisco, Calif., on Thursday. The flurry of announcements comes as AMD continues to battle AI market leader Nvidia ( ) and looks to take greater market share from longtime rival Intel ( ) in the server CPU space. The company showed off its new 5th Gen AMD EPYC central processing units (CPU) for servers, provided details on its Instinct MI325X AI accelerator, and showed off its Ryzen AI PRO 300 processors for AI PCs for enterprise customers. Shares of AMD fell more than 4% in afternoon trading. AMD contended that its top-of-the-line 5th Gen EPYC 9965 chips, which cost $14,813, beat out Intel’s fifth-generation Xeon server chips — with servers running AMD’s processors offering 4x faster video transcoding times; 3.9x improvements in time to insights, the time it takes to turn data into useable information for science and high-performance computing applications; and 1.6x performance per core in virtualized infrastructure. In other words: AMD wants you to know its chip can outpace Intel’s in certain scenarios. Intel debuted its next-generation Xeon 6 chip in September, but AMD says it hasn’t been able to get its hands on the processor to test it against its EPYC chip. On the AI accelerator side, AMD offered more details about its MI325X chip. The company says the data center processor beasts out Nvidia’s popular H200 AI chip when it comes to memory bandwidth and capacity, with the MI325X providing 256GB of HBM3E, a form of high-bandwidth memory used in AI processors. AMD said the MI325X features 1.8x higher memory capacity than Nvidia’s H200 and 1.3x more bandwidth. According to the chipmaker, companies including Dell ( ), Eviden, Gigabyte, HPE ( ), Lenovo ( ), and Super Micro Computer ( ) will begin offering MI325-based platforms in the first quarter of 2025. The company also said it’s gearing up for its MI350X, the follow-up to the MI325X, which will debut in the second half of next year. Nvidia, meanwhile, is working with customers to deploy its next-generation Blackwell-based AI servers. The data center has become the new battlefield for AMD, Nvidia, and Intel, as the companies seek to take advantage of the ongoing AI gold rush and grab as many customers as possible. And that’s translated to some big time cash for AMD and Nvidia. In its most recent quarter, AMD reported record Data Center sales of $2.8 billion, up 115% year over year. Still, that’s a far cry from Nvidia’s Data Center business, which reported revenue of $26.3 billion, jumping 154% year over year. Intel, on the other hand, is contending with a massive turnaround effort as it looks to regain its footing in the data center space. In its most recent quarter, the company reported that its Data Center revenue fell 3% year over year, dropping to $3 billion. The decline is part of a broader trend for Intel, which saw its full-year 2023 Data Center revenue fall a staggering 20% compared to 2022. In addition to its data center offerings, AMD showed off its new Ryzen AI PRO 300 processors for enterprise PCs. The company says its high-end version of the PRO 300, the Ryzen AI 9 HX PRO 375, gets 40% better performance and 14% faster productivity performance than Intel’s Core Ultra 7 165U chip. But the 165U is one of Intel’s first-generation Core Ultra processors, and the company has already announced its second-generation Core Ultra chips, which Intel says offer both better performance and battery life than its first-generation offerings. Both AMD and Intel are chasing the hope that AI PCs will goose PC sales, as enterprise and commercial customers look to replace the aging PCs they bought at the onset of the pandemic. So far, however, those efforts aren’t bearing much fruit. According to Gartner,  , despite the hype around AI PCs. Still, with the holiday season around the corner, there’s ample opportunity for the companies to pitch consumers on the benefits of AI PCs.

{"title": "Federal housing leaders speak to the need for more reverse mortgage understanding", "content": " (FHA) Commissioner   and David Berenbaum, deputy assistant secretary for the Office of Housing Counseling at the   (HUD), described a need for more reverse mortgage comprehension during an interview at this year’s   (NRMLA) Annual Meeting and Expo in San Diego. As the interest rate environment  , the likelihood that existing Home Equity Conversion Mortgage ( ) borrowers will seek a refinance increases. Counseling plays a crucial role in educating reverse mortgage borrowers and their trusted advisers about the program’s features, obligations and instances when a   will provide a tangible benefit. Gordon recently opined that more HUD-approved housing   should be trained to work with HECM borrowers, particularly because of the changing rate environment. She   during an online housing conference hosted by HUD in September. When asked to expand on her thoughts, she offered perspective on just how important a role counseling plays in the HECM program. “I consider the requirement for counseling for a reverse mortgage to be an integral part of the program, without which I would not be comfortable with this program,” she explained. “That’s because it is so complicated that even experienced mortgage professionals who work on   don’t necessarily understand the product.” Comprehension of the program’s particulars is extremely important for all parties impacted by the transaction. This is especially true for the borrower choosing to take on the loan as well as the people they most trust to advise them on their affairs. “For potential borrowers, for the consumers, it’s that important that they truly understand the features of this program before they enter into a loan,” she said. “And I think that that is just as imperative when refinancing as when getting an original reverse mortgage, since the requirements aren’t quite the same.” A small group of borrowers who meet certain criteria may not have to get counseling, Gordon said, but she hopes they choose to go through a session anyway. But she also feels that those who may not be forced to get the counseling today should potentially have that requirement in the future. “I hope that they will get counseling, and I think it’s important to look at whether they should be required to get counseling,” she said. “But even for borrowers for whom it’s not required, I strongly believe it’s advisable.” Berenbaum chimed in by saying that the Office of Housing Counseling is preparing a series of informational brochures for the housing counseling community that are designed for use by consumers. He said that when it comes to interest rates, patience might be the key since they could drop further. “At least, that’s what many of the prognosticators are saying out there right now,” Berenbaum said. “But particularly with regard to elders, there are a lot of real issues that have to be discussed, and that includes the age of the homeowner, what they see is their immediate, long-term needs in the home, and issues with regard to some of the associated costs and fees associated with a refinance.” But the tangible savings that might be gained from a refi also need to be established before moving forward, he added, since these savings might be less than what a particular homeowner estimates. “It’s good to have a trusted adviser,” he said. “I am hopeful. One of the topics at this meeting, NRMLA is interested in discussing the availability of counseling, having stronger best practices, as well as perhaps a stronger standard. And I always applaud strong homeowner education in any choice that is made.”", "date": "2024-10-10", "time": "21:22:29.000", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/federal-housing-leaders-speak-more-212229290.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9maW5hbmNlLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzLw&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEVfPVEASIT_EVG7Ar3pZP3EFIb7yCyfXZREkyo7-1b5dWIKzVBmgjFfwhaeKV7SIkNetwpNNPgFLPMpbl6g0kuXE7b5o0zS7FnvNfVKfAzP9AyUzqS8og85cBkWxxDWYZgvueIRl4OBSgE41R2jbhZsfZjOCCOPPu-qJObxPy9V"},

Investors and, as of Thursday, Swedish furniture shop IKEA want fiscal stimulus to reinvigorate the economy.

{"title": "Bitnomial sues SEC over XRP futures, challenges agency's continued claim that XRP is a security", "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission still firmly believes that the cryptocurrency XRP is a security, FOX Business has learned. The revelation comes following a   filed in an Illinois district court Thursday evening by crypto derivatives exchange Bitnomial, which sued Wall Street’s top cop over its claim that it has jurisdiction over a planned futures contract that tracks the price of XRP, the seventh-largest digital asset by market cap. Bitnomial, which is regulated by the SEC’s sister agency the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, filed for the XRP US Dollar Futures contract in August following the conclusion of the SEC’s lawsuit against blockchain payments firm Ripple, where a federal judge ruled against the SEC’s claim that XRP is a security. According to Bitnomial’s lawsuit, the SEC contacted the exchange shortly after the filing, claiming that XRP Futures are \"security futures\" that are subject to joint SEC and CFTC jurisdiction, and that Bitnomial would be violating federal securities laws if it proceeded with the listing. The SEC also said Bitnomial would be required to comply with additional requirements before listing XRP Futures, including registering as a national securities exchange. \"The SEC takes the view that the underlying asset, XRP, is an investment contract and, therefore, transactions in XRP constitute a security under the Securities Exchange Act,\" the lawsuit states. \"Bitnomial disagrees with the SEC’s view that XRP is an investment contract and, therefore, a security, and that XRP Futures are thus security futures.\" The SEC had no immediate comment. The SEC's claim that XRP futures are securities futures is a further escalation in the turf war between the SEC and CFTC, which are currently vying for sole jurisdiction over digital assets. Bitnomial believes its lawsuit will help provide some clarity about how crypto derivatives should be regulated and which regulator should oversee them. The CFTC currently oversees futures contracts for bitcoin and ether, the only two digital assets the SEC has deemed to be non-securities. In addition to seeking a declaration from a judge that XRP Futures are not securities futures, Bitnomial is asking the court to issue an order that prevents the SEC from claiming authority over XRP Futures and taking any legal action against Bitnomial related to its product offering. \"Establishing this precedent is not just about XRP; it’s about all digital assets,\" Bitnomial CEO Luke Hoersten tells FOX Business. \"Unlike other U.S. businesses in litigation with the SEC, Bitnomial has not been accused of wrongdoing,\" he said. \"As such, we are in a unique position to push for a court decision on the securities or commodities classification of XRP futures following the landmark determination as a non-security in the Southern District of New York case.\" Bitnomial's case puts the   of whether XRP is a security back in a district court at the same time the issue could be put before the Second Circuit. The SEC filed a notice of appeal in the Ripple case last week, signaling that it will likely contest a New York federal judge's decision that XRP, when traded on exchanges, is not a security. Ripple filed a notice of cross-appeal on Thursday, but neither entity has disclosed the specifics of their appeals. Bitnomial’s lawsuit is the second one filed against the SEC this week.

But one doesn’t have to be rich to travel, stated  , the founder of the Nomadness Travel Tribe and Nomadness TV. “It’s the psychology,” Robinson told Money Glow Up host Tiffany Aliche (video above; listen below). “People were fed this story that [travel] was only for the elite, that it was only in a luxury basis that people were able to go out into the world. … You can do anything, you just have to be realistic with what your boundaries are.” Even Aliche admitted that she didn’t feel like she could travel until she was in her 30s. “In my 20s, I just felt like I really couldn’t afford it,” Aliche recalled. “I was a preschool teacher, and I was like where am I going to get the money? Once I started to plan for it in my 30s I realized it wasn’t as expensive as I thought.” It’s easy to dismiss something like travel as though it’s not a necessity, and though it may not be as vital in a budget as one’s rent or grocery bill, Robinson said. However, “the character development is something you take with you your whole life.” Robinson noted that group travel options can help take away some of the planning hassle while providing a dedicated community. But this route may not be for everyone — whether that be due to personality differences or budget constraints. “Every time you incorporate someone else who’s helping you with [planning], you have to pay that person,” Robinson explained. “Everything [gets] more expensive.” Conversely, travelers can reduce costs by planning their own travel. According to Robinson, there are plenty of resources readily available for those looking for more budget-friendly options. Certain websites, like Skyscanner.com, can make international travel more affordable by allowing users to leave their final destination open and sort possible flights by price, highlighting some of the cheapest options available. Setting up a separate bank account that’s not easily accessible is another option for those who find themselves going over budget often, as adding extra steps to withdraw your money can make it easier to leave savings alone. “You can do it in a way that doesn’t break your bank,” Robinson explained. “Just bridge your travel budget with your travel style where you are in this phase of life.” Paying in installments is another hack that can make it easier to financially plan for a trip, Robinson noted. \"It's like, don't look at the big ticket item — the big price — all at once,\" Robinson said. \"Work with people, organizations, travel agents, or on your own, and get an installment plan done.\" And if all of the above options don’t seem to work, think smaller, Robinson said. For instance, she noted that the US has plenty of national parks and hidden gems that are likely much closer than one would think — it just takes some creativity and research. “Bring it down to life,” Robinson said. “Don’t make it a big daunting or super intimidating project. … Travel can look like whatever you need it to look like within your provisions”    ", "date": "2024-10-10", "time": "17:00:34.000", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-you-dont-have-to-be-rich-to-travel-the-world-170034853.html"},
{"title": "Housing inflation eased in September in 'sharp reversal' from previous month", "content": "September's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report came in  , but the data offered one major point of optimism: Shelter cost increases came down during the month, flashing   that the most stubborn contributor to inflation may finally be giving ground. According to data from the   released Thursday, shelter costs — which, along with food, contributed over 75% of the monthly increase in consumer prices — ticked up 0.2% month over month in September, lower than August's 0.5% increase. On an annual basis, shelter cost increases rose 4.9% in September, down from August's year-over-year gain of 5.2%. \"The sharp reversal in shelter inflation allays fears that it could reaccelerate after the jump in August and brings the trend back toward the gradual disinflation that we continue to expect,\" said Parker Ross, global chief economist at Arch Capital Group. For over a year, the stickiness of rent prices reflected in the CPI report has confounded policymakers even as separate data has shown rents have come down from their 2022 highs. Economists have expected a slowdown in rent increases as the Federal Reserve's tightening campaign eased pricing pressures across the economy. Part of the discrepancy can be explained because BLS collects rent data every six months. \"Shelter is still a key driver in price increases, though our analysis shows it will continue to moderate in line with median home prices,\" said Constance Hunter, chief economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. According to the report, rents gained 0.3% in September from the previous month, slightly lower than August's 0.4% increase. Owners' equivalent rent also showed signs of cooling, rising 0.3% for the month, slowing down from August's 0.5% increase. Owners' equivalent rent is the estimated rent a homeowner would pay if they were renting their own property. Overall, September CPI rose 0.2% over the previous month, matching the monthly increase from August but coming in hotter than economist estimates of a 0.1% increase. Economists continue to believe CPI data will eventually show a consistent deceleration in rental prices. \"The takeaway for the Fed is that the alternative measures of shelter cost inflation have been pointing to a cool down for a while now. But the Fed has their report card, and now the shelter part of the report card is looking better,\" said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank. \"Shelter is a big part of a cost of living so shelter inflation coming down is going a long way towards getting overall inflation back to the Fed's target.\" Despite the encouraging September data, some economists see shelter inflation posing a lingering challenge to the Fed because of the lack of supply of homes for sale and fresh interest rate cuts, which could put upward pressure on rents. Just as the CPI print starts to reflect lagging trends, rent increases might start accelerating again. “We remain concerned that we will not see much further disinflation in the OER or rent going forward, as modest rate cuts may spur more demand and may not be enough to make construction a more attractive prospect,” Thomas Simons, an economist at Jefferies, wrote in a note Thursday.", "date": "2024-10-10", "time": "15:29:00.000", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/housing-inflation-eased-in-september-in-sharp-reversal-from-previous-month-143621096.html"},
{"title": "WeightWatchers stock soars, but its cheap Wegovy knockoff 'is not a sustainable long-term business model'", "content": "WeightWatchers ( ) is trying to save its ailing business by betting on a market that threatens its very existence. The weight-loss company, previously championed by the likes of Oprah Winfrey, saw its stock spike this week after announcing that it will make copycats of Novo Nordisk's ( ) Ozempic and Wegovy weight-loss drugs. WW International (i.e. WeightWatchers) stock jumped nearly 40% Wednesday following the news, and the stock climbed an additional 23% Thursday to close at $1.96. WW is up 172% from last week. Though WeightWatchers’ core business is its dieting program, the company has attempted to get in on the booming weight-loss drug market dominated by pharmaceutical giants Eli Lilly ( ) and Novo Nordisk  . (The strategy was championed by its former CEO Sima Sistani, who  .) WeightWatchers first attempted to secure a foothold in the weighty drug space early last year with its  , a telehealth platform specializing in weight-loss medication management. The acquisition has failed to improve the company’s revenue, which fell 14.5% in 2023 and is expected to decline another 13% this year.  that it will offer compounded GLP-1 drugs — which are cheaper and don't require insurance — is another shot at capitalizing on the market late in the game. Federal laws allow companies to sell compounded versions of drugs on the US Food and Drug Administration’s shortage list. Regulations allow the drugs to be made at FDA-registered facilities, but the compounded medications themselves are not FDA-approved. WeightWatchers will offer a compounded semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy. Here's the rub: Once the Novo Nordisk drugs are removed from the FDA’s shortage list, WeightWatchers will no longer be able to produce compounded semaglutide drugs at scale. Tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly's Mounjaro and Zepbound, was  , posing a massive problem for companies making compounded versions of the drug. “Compounding is not a sustainable long-term business model,” Barclays ( ) healthcare technology and distribution analyst Stephanie Davis told Yahoo Finance. Davis is one of four Wall Street analysts covering the stock tracked by Bloomberg. Half of those analysts have Equal Weight ratings on WW, and Davis is one of the other two analysts who recommend selling the stock. Meanwhile, WeightWatchers’ expansion in the weight-loss drug space contradicts its core business. “GLP-1s are going to cannibalize the diet industry,” Davis said. WeightWatchers did not immediately respond to questions from Yahoo Finance on Thursday. To illustrate the weakness of WeightWatchers’ strategy, Davis pointed to the rapid boom and bust of Hims & Hers Health ( ) stock. Shares of the telehealth company surged after  . The stock climbed 70% from the time of the announcement in May to a closing high of around $24.79 in mid-June. Then, when the FDA removed tirzepatide from its shortage list — a gloomy sign for sellers of compounded GLP-1s —  . HIMS shares dropped another 10% on Oct. 2 when the   citing concerns over compounded drugs — which are not reviewed for safety, effectiveness, or quality before they’re marketed. More trouble for WW?   that found impurities in compounded versions of its drug — raising questions about the safety and efficacy of compounded semaglutide medications in particular. Morgan Stanley's ( ) Nathan Feather, on the other hand, believes that it’s not too late for WeightWatchers to turn things around. He said WeightWatchers’ failures to successfully monetize its GLP-1 telehealth offering — something it gained through its purchase of Sequence — has been due to its clients’ lack of insurance coverage for the drugs and the company's shortcomings in the advertising space, rather than weakness in its core business. WeightWatchers’ new, cheaper compound GLP-1 offering, which don’t require insurance, could help overcome those issues. “Given the sudden [market] share reversal [for WW International] was primarily due to the inability to compete in ad markets rather than consumer dissatisfaction with the Clinic program, we believe the launch of compounding addresses the primary constraint to growth,” Feather said in a note to investors Tuesday. He added: “The bar for execution is high with diet season rapidly approaching” in addition to “investor concerns on the liquidity profile.” Feather maintains his Equal Weight rating on the stock, contending that WeightWatchers’ GLP-1 offering is only a temporary solution. “As GLP-1s are removed from the shortage list, this could lead to large-scale churn events if WW is unable to continue servicing clients using compounded medication,” he said.", "date": "2024-10-10", "time": "21:56:54.000", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weightwatchers-stock-soars-but-its-cheap-wegovy-knockoff-is-not-a-sustainable-long-term-business-model-203901403.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9maW5hbmNlLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzLw&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEVfPVEASIT_EVG7Ar3pZP3EFIb7yCyfXZREkyo7-1b5dWIKzVBmgjFfwhaeKV7SIkNetwpNNPgFLPMpbl6g0kuXE7b5o0zS7FnvNfVKfAzP9AyUzqS8og85cBkWxxDWYZgvueIRl4OBSgE41R2jbhZsfZjOCCOPPu-qJObxPy9V"},

Most Read from Bloomberg Alumina surged as much as 6.4% to 4,630 yuan ($655) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange on Friday, its highest since the contract debuted in June 2023. The price for shipments from Western Australia climbed to $550 a ton, their best showing in data going back to 2021. Prices have rallied over the past year due to problems with supply in both China and Australia, as well as record Chinese aluminum output. The latest move higher may also have been triggered by reports of a supply interruption in Guinea, one of the world’s top suppliers of bauxite, a key raw material for alumina. Researcher Mysteel Global said on Friday that shipments of bauxite from a mine in Guinea may have been disrupted, without giving details. In January, Alcoa Corp. said it will shut its Kwinana alumina refinery in Western Australia. In May, Rio Tinto Group declared force majeure on cargoes from its refineries in Queensland, Australia, because of gas shortages. In China, alumina supplies have been constrained by a shortfall of bauxite amid environmental inspections. Chinese alumina producers have boosted output to take advantage of the strong market.

{"title": "US 30-year mortgage rises to 6.32%, biggest weekly gain since April, Freddie Mac says", "content": "(Reuters) - The average rate on the popular U.S. 30-year mortgage rate increased to 6.32% this week, its largest one week increase since April, as a string of stronger-than-expected economic data caused investors to scale back bets on further Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 20 basis points higher than a week earlier when it averaged 6.12%, mortgage finance giant Freddie Mac said on Thursday. It averaged 7.57% during the same period a year ago. The 30-year rate closely tracks the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. That jumped last week after job growth in September blew past predictions and the unemployment rate fell, prompting traders to price in smaller, and fewer, Fed rate cuts over coming months than previously anticipated. The reversal comes after mortgage rates declined steadily since May as investors geared up for the Fed to begin a rate-cutting cycle, which it began last month. Financial market bets currently reflect an expectation that the Fed will reduce its policy rate, now in the 4.75%-5.00% range, to a range of 3.50%-3.75% by the middle of next year.

{"title": "Fed official delivers surprising words about next Fed rate cut", "content": "The standard betting about interest rates is that the Federal Reserve will cut them twice more this year. The Fed cut its key Federal Funds Rate in September, trimmed it to a range of 4.75% to 5% from 5.25% to 5.5%. That was its first rate cut since 2000 during the Covid-19 pandemic. The central bank moved because its 11 rate increases between early 2022 and July 2023 had succeeded in cutting inflation but also seemed to be slowing the domestic economy more than the Fed expected or wanted. But last week's stronger-than-expected jobs report for September and, on Thursday, a Consumer Price Index report showing inflation running hotter than anticipated has thrown the conventional wisdom into a bit of disarray. Indeed, one voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's rate-making body, said Thursday he'd be happy if the Fed skipped a rate cut at its November meeting. Tom Williams/Getty Images Raphael Bostic told The Wall Street Journal, \"I am totally comfortable with skipping a meeting if the data suggests that's appropriate.\" Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, made his comment in an interview after the Labor Department reported the CPI rose 2.4% in September over the prior 12 months. The expectations were for a 2.3% year-over-year increase. Bostic said both the jobs and CPI reports were exhibiting some \"choppiness.\" That suggested, he told the Journal, \"Maybe we should take a pause in November.\" One reason for concern is that prices might be pressured upward as Floridians start to spend heavily to repair homes, cars and other property damaged by hurricanes Helene and Milton. Milton hit the west coast of Florida on Wednesday and crossed the state before heading into the Atlantic Ocean. Bostic, one of the more hawkish members of the FOMC this year, agreed to a 50-basis point (0.5-percentage-point) cut at the Sept. 17-18 Fed meeting. One FOMC member, Governor Michelle Bowman, cast the only no vote on the decision. But it's become clearer that the vote to cut to 4.75% to 5% was not enthusiastic. Most officials agreed that the Federal Funds Rate should be cut, but many have suggested 25 basis points seemed more appropriate. Bostic's comments had added some selling pressure to the stock market on Thursday. The S&P 500 index was off 0.2%, the Nasdaq Composite had given up 0.1% and the Dow Jones industrials were off 58 points. The S&P 500 and Dow had closed at records on Wednesday. The rate cut, in fact, has proved to be a near-term bottom on interest rates generally. Freddie Mac's weekly report on mortgage rates, released Thursday, showed the rate on a 30-year mortgage rate hitting 6.32%, up from 6.12% a week earlier and up from a low of 6.08% in its Sept. 19 report.

{"title": "A Restaurant That Only Sells Chicken Fingers? This 'Stupid' Idea Made Him One Of The Richest People In The U.S. With $9.5 Billion", "content": "Todd Graves had a simple idea: a fast-food restaurant that sold only chicken fingers. And while that might sound like a winning idea now, when Graves pitched it as a college assignment in the mid-90s, it was anything but well-received. In fact, his professor at Louisiana State University gave him the lowest grade in the class, insisting that such a niche concept would never work in southern Louisiana.   him, too. They couldn’t imagine a restaurant with such a limited menu thriving. But Todd Graves wasn’t one to back down. With his dream of serving high-quality chicken fingers, he worked hard labor jobs – 90-hour weeks in California as a boilermaker and long days fishing for salmon in Alaska – just to save up the money to get started. By 1996, Graves had enough funds to open the first Raising Cane’s in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, near LSU. He named it after his beloved yellow Labrador retriever, Cane, who had been a frequent visitor at the construction site. The opening wasn’t smooth; technical issues delayed the grand debut until late at night, but Graves wasn’t discouraged. He took to the streets to wave in customers and the restaurant stayed open until 3:30 a.m. That grassroots hustle paid off – the chicken fingers, Texas Toast and legendary Cane’s Sauce quickly gained fans. Those early customers weren’t just patrons – they became “Caniacs,” the dedicated followers of Raising Cane’s. Today, Raising Cane’s has over 800 locations worldwide, including flagship spots in Times Square, Miami Beach and Las Vegas. The company generated $3.7 billion in net sales last year and aims for nearly 900 restaurants by the end of 2024. Todd Graves, now worth an estimated $9.5 billion, owns over 90% of the business and has no intention of selling it. He wants his kids to take over and carry on the company’s values after he's gone. Despite the initial rejections and setbacks, Graves made his dream a reality – and then some. His journey hasn’t been easy, though. He had to learn some painful lessons, such as nearly leaving the business when Hurricane Katrina caused him to close 21 of 28 restaurants. And since he had to rely on  , he had to learn the hard way how to balance debt and equity. But he survived those challenges and Raising Cane’s came back stronger. Graves also has a passion for giving back. During the pandemic, when many restaurants were struggling, he launched the Discovery+ series Restaurant Recovery, which helped independent restaurant owners get back on their feet. To keep all 25,000 of Raising Cane’s employees employed, Graves and his co-CEO, AJ Kumaran, even gave up their paychecks during that period. As the wealthiest resident in Louisiana, Graves believes in putting his employees first and providing possibilities. As a result, the company creates more than 10,000 new jobs annually, aiming to eventually reach 1,600 locations and employ 150,000 crew members.

{"title": "Wall Street Veteran Says China Stocks Set to Surge Another 50%", "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The way Jeff deGraaf sees it, hedge funds that sold a record amount of Chinese shares earlier this week toward the end of the CSI 300’s 10-day, 35% surge are in for a world of regret. Most Read from Bloomberg In fact, says the co-founder and chief executive officer of Renaissance Macro Research, rarely in his more than three-decade Wall Street career have the stars aligned so perfectly for a lengthy rally. “Skepticism, valuation, stimulus, momentum and a trend change,” they’re all there, he said in an interview. It’s because of that backdrop that the Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch veteran is now one of the biggest China bulls on Wall Street. He predicts the country’s benchmark gauge will hit 6,000 in the next 12 months, a more than 50% advance. DeGraaf, who ranked as the top technical analyst in Institutional Investor’s annual survey for 11 straight years through 2015, says that it’s no coincidence that Beijing rolled out its most aggressive monetary easing in years as equities tested their year-to-date lows last month. “Markets drive policy as much as policy drives markets,” he said. His forecast compares with Morgan Stanley’s newly revised CSI 300 target of 4,000 by June 2025, implying virtually no upside from Thursday’s close. The index plunged 7.1% on Wednesday, the second day mainland markets reopened after the Golden Week holidays. While it rose 1% Thursday, enthusiasm over a stimulus-driven equity surge is cooling due to the lack of any further major initiatives at a key policy meeting earlier this week. DeGraaf recommends investors “keep stops in place and don’t get dogmatic” when wagering on China. For now, traders are awaiting the outcome of a finance ministry briefing on fiscal policy due Saturday. “We see the policy response as self-preservation, a reaction to the weakness and a potential Mario Draghi-esque ‘Do what it takes’ moment for China,” deGraaf said. The former Lehman chief technical analyst also downplayed potential risks to Chinese shares from the upcoming US presidential election. It’s a “side show, probably doesn’t matter much, and a reaction would be an opportunity,” he said.
