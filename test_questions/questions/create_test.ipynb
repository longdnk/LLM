    "1. Preprocess the Article: First, you need to preprocess the article to extract relevant information. This typically includes:\n",
    "- Splitting the article into sentences or paragraphs.\n",
    "- Identifying key entities and facts, such as people, places, dates, events, and important concepts.\n",
    "- Optionally, perform part-of-speech tagging or named entity recognition (NER) to assist in generating meaningful questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Identify Important Information: \n",
    "Determine the key pieces of information from the article that can be turned into questions. Some examples of important > information include:\n",
    "- Who did something? (Person-related facts)\n",
    "- What happened? (Events)\n",
    "- When did something occur? (Dates and time)\n",
    "- Where did something happen? (Places)\n",
    "- Why did something happen? (Explanations or reasons)\n",
    "- How did something happen? (Processes or sequences)\n",
    "By identifying these details, you can focus on producing questions that revolve around these key facts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Generate Questions\n",
    "Aim to generate a variety of question types:\n",
    "- Factual: \"When did X happen?\"\n",
    "- Definition: \"What is X?\"\n",
    "- Causal: \"Why did X happen?\"\n",
    "- Procedural: \"How does X work?\"\n",
    "- Inference: \"What can be inferred about X?\"\n",
